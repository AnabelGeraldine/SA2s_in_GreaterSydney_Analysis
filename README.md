# SA2s in Greater Sydney Analysis

- Spearheaded an age prediction analysis for abalone using RStudio, from initial problem identification
through to data understanding and exploration. Investigated potential relationships within the data, employing correlation visuals to examine interactions between various variables.
- Performed comprehensive data transformations to prepare for advanced modeling, utilizing techniques
such as forward and backward selection and log-linear models.
- Evaluated model performance rigorously using metrics such as RMSE, R-squared, and MAE, while also
verifying assumptions and addressing multicollinearity to ensure robustness.
- Developed and delivered insightful presentations and detailed reports, effectively communicating
findings and recommendations to stakeholders through the strategic use of R-generated visualizations
and narratives.

The Abalone Age Prediction project successfully developed a model to estimate the age of abalones using physical measurement data. Through data preprocessing, feature selection, and exploratory data analysis, various regression models were tested, including log-linear models and stepwise selection techniques. The model was evaluated using RMSE, R-squared, and MAE, ensuring robustness by addressing multicollinearity and verifying key assumptions.

The final model demonstrated a reasonable predictive performance, offering insights into the relationship between abalone physical characteristics and their age, which can be useful for ecological studies and commercial fisheries management.
