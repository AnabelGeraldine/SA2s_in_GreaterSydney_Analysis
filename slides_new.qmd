# The Problem {background-color="black" background-image="abalone_workers.avif" background-size="cover"}

::: notes
Being able to accurately determine the age of abalone is a pressing
issue in marine biology research and sustainable management of abalone
production. Traditional methods are invasive, labor-intensive and
potentially harmful to the abalone population. The problem this study
addresses is the lack of an efficient, non-intrusive method for
estimating the age of Abalones.
:::

## The Traditional Method {background-image="traditional.png" background-size="cover"}

::: notes
The traditional method of determining an abalone's age is by cutting the
shell through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of rings
under a microscope. This method is so tedious and time-consuming that by
the time the age is determined, abalones can no longer survive
(Indumathi, 2021).
:::

## A Solution {background-color="rgba(231,248,255,255)"}

![](future_abalone.png){.absolute top="50" left="200"}

::: notes
A more efficient method would be if researchers and harvesters could
accurately predict the age of abalones based on it's physical traits.
Our analysis aims to build a predictive model to do exactly that. This
would transform the process of determining an abalone's age into just
minutes of measuring it's size, determining the sex and weighing it's
parts.

::: notes
Knowing the age of abalone directly affects what their value is and
their eligibility for breeding. So it is no debate that such predictive
capabilities would provide better production efficiency, cost reduction,
and the provision of more precise data for abalone farming and market
transactions, thereby significantly transforming abalone industry.

## Visualization

```{r,echo = FALSE,include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
aba <- read.csv("abalone.data",header = FALSE)
colnames(aba) <- c("Sex", "Length", "Diameter", "Height", "Whole_weight", "Shucked_weight", "Viscera_weight", "Shell_weight", "Rings") # create column name
remove_outliers <- function(x) {
  qnt <- quantile(x, probs = c(.25, .75), na.rm = TRUE)
  H <- 1.5 * IQR(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  x[x < (qnt[1] - H) | x > (qnt[2] + H)] <- NA
  return(x)
} #remove the outliers for every column


sex <- aba$Sex
aba_numeric <- aba[sapply(aba, is.numeric)]
aba_clean <- lapply(aba_numeric, remove_outliers)
aba_clean <- as.data.frame(aba_clean)
aba_clean$Sex <- sex
aba_clean <- na.omit(aba_clean) # remove the lines contain NA
aba <- aba_clean %>% mutate(age = Rings + 1.5)
```

```{r,echo = FALSE}
library(GGally)
library(dplyr)

aba %>% 
  select(age, Length, Diameter, Height, Sex, Whole_weight) %>%
  GGally::ggpairs(mapping = ggplot2::aes(color = Sex))
```

:::notes

From scatter plots. firstly We noticed a relative high correlation between the 'Whole_weight' variable and other independent variables so we remove this. Moreover, the linear relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable was not significant, which lead us to consider transformations.
:::

## Transformation
```{r,echo = FALSE,include = FALSE}
aba <- aba %>% mutate(logage = log(age),logdiameter = log(Diameter))
```

```{r,echo = FALSE,include = FALSE}

aba %>% 
  select(logage, Length, Diameter, Height, Sex) %>%
  GGally::ggpairs(mapping = ggplot2::aes(color = Sex))
p2 <- aba %>% 
  select(logage, Length, logdiameter, Height, Sex) %>%
  GGally::ggpairs(mapping = ggplot2::aes(color = Sex))
p2
```

</div>

:::notes
Through iterative analysis, the left graph shows improved linearity when we apply a log transformation to the dependent variable. And, from the right graph, it seems logging the 'Diameter' further enhances its linear relationship with 'logage'.We build the model separately to compare their performances.

## Model Selection{.smaller}

```{r,echo = FALSE,include = FALSE}
# Coding for solve the first issue
aba <- aba[, -which(names(aba) %in% c("Whole_weight"))]
# Coding for solve the second issue
aba <- aba %>% mutate(logage = log(age),logdiameter = log(Diameter))
aba %>% 
  select(logage, Sex, Length, logdiameter, Height) %>%
  GGally::ggpairs(mapping = ggplot2::aes(color = Sex))
M2 = lm(logage ~ Sex+Height+Diameter+Length,data =aba)

# Prediction model with forward variable selection and backward selection before we remove SEXM
M1 = lm(logage ~ logdiameter + Height + Length + Sex, data = aba)
drop1(M1, test = "F")
M0 = lm(logage ~ 1, data = aba) # Null model
l_ini_for = step(M0, scope = list(lower = M0, upper = M1),
 direction = "forward", trace = FALSE)

#backward
l_ini_back = step(M1,direction = "backward", trace = FALSE)
aba <- filter(aba, Sex != "M" )

# Final model after we remove SexM
M1 = lm(logage ~ ., data = aba)
M0 = lm(logage ~ 1, data = aba) # Null model

l_final_for = step(M0, scope = list(lower = M0, upper = M1),
                         direction = "forward", trace = FALSE)

l_final_back = step(M1,direction = "backward", trace = FALSE)
summary(l_ini_for)
summary(l_ini_back)
summary(M2)
```


```{r,echo = FALSE}
sjPlot::tab_model(l_ini_for,l_ini_back,M2, show.ci = FALSE, show.aic = TRUE,
 dv.labels = c("Forward model","Backward model","log-linear"))
```



:::notes
We compared backward, forward, and log-linear models. Both backward and forward got the same prediction model, while log-linear differed with a higher AIC. We'll now proceed with cross-validation to determine the best model.

## Model Selection{.smaller}

```{r,echo = FALSE,include = FALSE}
library(caret)
cv_full = train(
 logage ~ logdiameter + Height + Length + Sex, aba,
 method = "lm",
 trControl = trainControl(
 method = "cv", number = 10,
 verboseIter = FALSE
 )
)
cv_full

```

```{r,echo = FALSE,include = FALSE}
cv_simple = train(
 logage ~ Diameter + Height + Length + Sex, 
 aba,
 method = "lm",
 trControl = trainControl(
 method = "cv", number = 10,
 verboseIter = FALSE
 )
)
cv_simple
```

```{r}

library(knitr)

data <- data.frame(
  Method = c("Forward Model", "log-linear Model"),
  RMSE = c(0.1521167, 0.1566072),
  Rsquared = c(0.5577794, 0.5322651),
  MAE = c(0.119185, 0.1221877)
)


kable(data, caption = "Comparison of Forward and Backward Methods", align = 'c')

```


```{r,echo = FALSE,include = FALSE}
summary(l_ini_for)$coe
```
:::notes
Lower RMSE and MAE, and higher R-squared indicate better predictions. The Forward model outperformed the log-linear, so we chose the former.
:::


## Assumptions

![](Assumption_1.png){.absolute top="100" left="250"}

::: notes
At this stage, we check the assumptions of our model.
For linearity, the plots indicate residuals symmetrically distributed above and below zero.
For homoskedasticity, in the middle portion of plot, the spread might be somewhat larger than the spread on the sides of this plot, but it's not particularly concerning.
:::

## Assumptions

![](Assumption_2.png){.absolute top="100" left="250"}

::: notes
For normality, we can validate using the QQ plot. Moreover, given our large sample size, we can also rely on the Central Limit Theorem to provide us with approximately valid inferences."
:::

## Multicollinearity

![Heatmap](Multicollinearity.png)

::: notes
We use Heatmap to verify the Multicollinearity between variables.

The overall color of each cell is dark and close to +1, which indicates a strong positive relationship between variables. The Logage's is slightly lighter, which means the correlation between logage and other variables is relatively weak. But since Logage is our predict variable, so its importance should not be underestimated.
:::

## Cross validation

$$RMSE = 0.1521207$$
$$Rsquared = 0.5553915$$
$$MAE = 0.1192136$$

::: notes
In order to further evaluate the performance of the model, we need to use cross validation.

In this model, RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) is 0.15. Mae (Mean Absolute Error) is 0.12. the lower these two, the higher the predictive accuracy of the model. But because in this data, the range of logage is from 1.7 to 2.8, so as a percentage, these are considered a large error.

R-squared represents the ratio of the variability of logage. 0.56 is relatively low since the data is physical variables.
:::

## Real Life Application

![(Western Abalone Divers Association, 2020)](fisherman.jpeg)

::: notes
Here is a scenario to which the predictive model can be applied. We first introduce the non-invasive method to a small group of fishermen to test the model’s practicality and efficiency. For example, a fisherman might find that the model is not accurate in polluted water, so we can refine the prediction algorithm for it. 
:::

## Broad Implementation

![(Australian Marine Conservation Society, 2023)](AMCS.png)

:::notes
The model will then be introduced to various fishing communities. After this, we will collaborate with the Australian Marine Conservation Society to produce handheld devices to enable users to follow sustainable fishing guidelines. We will also conduct regular workshops to educate fishermen on the importance of sustainable economic activity and keep them updated on the most accurate prediction model to maximise their benefits.
